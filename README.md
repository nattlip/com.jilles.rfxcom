# RFXCOM



This app receives and transmits to a Rfxcom lan Receiver and or Transmitter with normal software.
Is is not suitable for devices with xpl firmware. 
use then the other rfxcom app from irritanterik
https://apps.athom.com/app/com.rfxcom.rfxlan

Makes Homey backward compatible with classic domotica , Rfxcom is known for its superb transmitters , receiver and transceivers 
and your receiving and transmitter range is much bigger ,recpetiom is morte accurate.  
Also 868 visonic Devices can be added which was the most important reason to write this app.
Homey doesnt receive the 869.95 visonic devices at this moment


What works:

You can connect to a rfxcom device with the correct firmware eg as is used for Homeseer
to connect type the correct settings. and restart  the app 
visonic motion sensors and door sensors can be added and the capabilities are correct.


What doesn't:

all other devices .

To be implemented soon:

all operating modes of the receiver and transmitter
oregon devices
x10 devices 
sending x10 signals
